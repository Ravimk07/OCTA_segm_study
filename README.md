# Automated OCTA segmentation
This repository contains the code that has been used in the study described in ..., 
We proposed for the first time an extensive comparison of blood vessel segmentation methods in Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA).
Each folder represents a vessel enhancement method (Frangi, Gabor, SCIRD-TS, OOF, CNN, and UNet), plus functions to compute quality metrics (CAL). 
Folders contain README.md when necessary or comments to guide you through the code.  

## Data
Data will be available soon.
 
## Programming languages
The code contains scripts in matlab and python (jupyter notebook).
